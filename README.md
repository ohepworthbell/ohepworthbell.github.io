# Portfolio #

Portfolio of Oliver Hepworth-Bell. To set up, clone and run

```
npm i
```

# Local previewing/development

To preview the website locally, with hot reloading
```
npm start
```

# Building and deploying

To check that the website builds properly
```
npm run build
```

When deploying, the bulid stage is already included as part of the deployment process, so you don't need to write `npm run build` - though there is no harm in doing so. To deploy

```
npm run deploy
```
