# Portfolio

A personal portfolio of Oliver Hepworth-Bell, built using `Webpack` and deployed through `gh-pages`. To set up, clone and run

```
npm i
```

### Local previewing/development

To preview the website locally, running a development server with hot reloading
```
npm start
```

### Building and deploying

To check that the website builds properly
```
npm run build
```

When deploying, the bulid stage is already included as part of the deployment process, so you don't need to write `npm run build` - though there is no harm in doing so.

To deploy

```
npm run deploy
```
